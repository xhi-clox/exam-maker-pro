## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3B82F6), reminiscent of school uniforms, evoking feelings of trust and focus.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F9FF), of similar hue to the primary but much lighter and desaturated.
- Accent color: Purple (#8B5CF6), placed a little to the 'left' of the primary hue in order to give good contrast and complement the primary tone.
- Headline font: 'Poppins', sans-serif, suitable for short titles, menus, or other limited bodies of text. Body font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif, will serve well in paragraphs of normal length.
- Use relevant and clear icons, sourced from 'Lucide React', to visually represent question types and actions throughout the app.
- Design a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes, optimized for desktop and mobile devices used by Bangladeshi teachers.
- Implement subtle animations for UI transitions, loading states, and interactive feedback to improve the user experience without being distracting.
